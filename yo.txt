Currently only supports 16:9 resulotions.

To use overrides just copy the file you want from
the overrides folder and replace the file you want changed!

Transparent Viewmodels are now in the overrides folder.

If Transparent viewmodels don't work, add:

mat_motion_blur_enabled 1 //afaik the only sure-fire way to keep refract masking on
mat_motion_blur_strength 0 //effectively disables motion blur, personal choice + motion blur gets masked and looks bad with refract masking
mat_disable_bloom 1 //disables bloom so refract masking doesn't create a dark rectangle over light materials
mat_colcorrection_disableentities 1
mat_colorcorrection 0

To your autoexec!
